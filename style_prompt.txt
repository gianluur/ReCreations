C++ Code Refactoring Prompt
Refactor the following C++ code file. Apply all rules strictly, ensuring correct class/method ordering, separation of declaration/implementation, and use of Doxygen-style comments.

Refactoring Rules:
Doxygen Comments (// @tag):

Class/Namespace: Use // @brief for a quick explanation and // @param to explain any templates.

Method Declarations (inside class): Add // @brief, // @param, and // @return comments immediately preceding the signature.

Method Implementations (outside class): DO NOT repeat the Doxygen comments here, as they are considered redundant.

Class Structure and Order (Declaration Only):

Separate the body using public: and private: access specifiers.

Public Order:

init method (if present).

Constructor (Vector()), then Deconstructor (~Vector()).

Special Member Functions (Move/Copy/Assignment/etc.), fully documented with Doxygen comments.

All other Public Methods.

Private Order:

Private Attributes (Variables).

Private Methods (if present).

Implementation Separation:

The class definition (declaration) must only contain method signatures.

The complete function implementation (definition) must be placed after the class definition, under an appropriate heading (e.g., // === Implementation of ClassName<T> ===).

Implementation Commenting:

Comment what each logical block of code does within the function implementation (e.g., "Check capacity and reallocate if necessary," "Handle allocation failure"). Do not comment every single line.

Templates and Specialization:

If a class has a generic template and a specialization, the generic version must be placed and implemented first, followed by the specialized version.

Namespaces:

Apply the same structure and commenting rules (// @brief, public/private separation, declaration/implementation separation) to namespaces as you do for classes.
